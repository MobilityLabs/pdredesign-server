  <p>The PDredesign Data &amp; Tech Analysis is a free tool for school districts to get the big picture of their data and technology systems that support professional learning. The Analysis completes the Data &amp; Tech Landscape and brings together central office staff from across departments to discuss how current data systems, technology infrastructure, and product purchases documented in the Inventory are supporting teachers. The Analysis makes it easy to see how effectively technology is aligned to district needs and goals.</p>
  <p>The Analysis may be used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Share knowledge and build consensus across departments</li>
    <li>Gain a high-level insight into existing tools and capacities</li>
    <li>Define technical requirements for new technology purchases</li>
    <li>Understand return on investment for PD purchases</li>
    <li>Surface challenges and successes in new technology implementation</li>
    <li>Discover new products and resources recommended by EdSurge</li>
  </ul>
