  <p>The PDredesign Data & Technology Landscape Inventory is a free tool for school districts to get the big picture of their data and technology systems that support professional learning. Central office staff from across departments collaboratively add information about their current data systems and technology products to better understand how these systems impact different areas of teacher professional growth. The Inventory can be used on its own, but is most effective when completed after a Readiness Assessment. To take your Inventory to the next level, follow it with a Data & Technology Analysis.</p>
  <p>The Inventory may be used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Share knowledge across departments</li>
    <li>Gain a high-level insight into existing tools and costs</li>
    <li>Define technical requirements for new technology purchases</li>
  </ul>
