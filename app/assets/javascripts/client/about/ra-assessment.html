  <p>The Readiness Assessment helps a district understand how its current PD system is structured and where to focus collective energy for improvement. Through a collaborative process, the Readiness Assessment brings together voices from the central office, school buildings, and classrooms to ensure transformation is grounded in a collective vision. The assessment is organized around the critical components of any effective system.</p>
  <p>The PD Readiness Assessment is a formative tool used by districts to continually track transformation progress. The tool enables district personnel across departments to participate in an individual online survey followed by a collaborative, in-person consensus meeting. The consensus meeting results in a collective vision for redesign and a summary report of priority areas and next steps.</p>
