      <h1>Welcome to PDredesign</h1>
      <p>PDredesign is a digital toolkit and community of practice dedicated to improving professional development for
        educators. The PDredesign tools were collaboratively designed with school districts who wanted to support their
        teachers
        through more relevant, flexible, timely and interactive professional development opportunities. These tools are
        freely
        available on PDredesign.org and can be used by any school district to transform existing professional development
        systems to better support teachers in the classroom.</p>
