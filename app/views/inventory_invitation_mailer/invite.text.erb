PDredesign is a digital toolkit dedicated to improving professional development for educators. The
PDredesign tools were designed with school districts who wanted to support their teachers through more
relevant, flexible, timely and collaborative professional development opportunities. The toolkit is freely
available on PDredesign.org and can be used by any school district to transform existing professional
development systems to better support teachers in the classroom.
